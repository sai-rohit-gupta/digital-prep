These were the resources that i have gone through i cannot assure this will make u crack DCA but i can say these are some good place u can start from as a resource


Hello All , this is the dump for DCA that i have used for aptitude , 
regarding coding i have gone through concepts in w3 schools and googled some concepts on strings i recommend to do some handson like 2 codes per topic if u are not very good at coding and if u are good there is noting to say u know what to do ,
and comming to reasoning and verbal there is not anything much to say these topics are like if u practice 20 there will a new 21st question only thing is more u practice more faster u can get through them i will also try to put some useful places u can refer or practice
The most Important one i have gone through is this playlist of IT india youtube channel  :  https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2SluYPF9ZQXqVuw9-Z5zIPhCqMRwcSlf
i have kept the vedios of the same in this repo in file named "preparation" even if the channel delists them we can have the content , i have ordered them numbering 1, 2 ...... as file starting name 
i will keep my personal notes that i made for my self for revision through concepts.
